# Community benchmark on NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090

Measured on 2026-10-22 with `tools/strata_bench.py` (suite 1, 3 runs per test, medians with ranges). Speeds are the engine's own timings; first-token times are measured by the client over HTTP. Speed only: no correctness check was run.

## Hardware and software

- GPU and VRAM: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090, 24 GiB VRAM
- CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D 8-Core Processor (8 cores, 16 threads); installed RAM: 93.9 GiB; storage: not measured
- OS: Linux 7.2.5-3-omarchy; GPU driver: 610.57.04; CUDA: not read
- Strata: project 0.1.43.1, commit a85301ca; engine 0.1.43.1
- Background workloads and power limits: not recorded

## Model and configuration

- Model and quantization: qwen3.8-flash-next-unsloth-ud-iq4_xs
- Context: 262144 tokens; parallel slots: 1
- Settings: the install's own configuration, unchanged; thinking off for the suite; temperature 0

## Method

Run by `python tools/strata_bench.py` against the HTTP API of a Strata server (already running); model loading is not timed. One warm-up chat and a 1K prompt are discarded first. Every prompt starts with a unique tag, so the conversation cache cannot help the fresh-prompt tests.

- short chat: the three questions of `tools/ab_engine.py`, up to 100 new tokens, 3 runs
- 4K / 16K prompts: generated word lists sized by a calibration request, 24 new tokens, 3 fresh prompts each
- agent session: system prompt and four tools, then 5 turns that each add about 1500 words of a project file and continue from the model's own earlier answers (the way agent clients resend a conversation), 64 new tokens per turn, 3 sessions; the cache numbers come from the answer's usage (`cached_tokens`) and timings (`prompt_n`)
- concurrency (when run): N requests sent at the same moment, total tokens over the wall time of the burst, latency over all requests

## Results

| Configuration | Actual prompt tokens | Reused tokens | Generated tokens | Runs | Prompt tok/s median and range | Decode tok/s median and range | TTFT seconds median and range |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- | --- | --- |
| short chat | 46 (43-51) | 0 | 100 (100-100) | 9 | not measured | 123.9 (99.4-142.7) | 0.20 (0.19-0.29) |
| 4K prompt, fresh | 4019 (4019-4019) | 0 (0-0) | 24 cap | 3 | 2311.1 (2250.7-2315.4) | not measured | 1.76 (1.76-1.81) |
| 16K prompt, fresh | 16058 (16058-16058) | 0 (0-0) | 24 cap | 3 | 2827.0 (2825.8-2837.0) | not measured | 5.71 (5.69-5.71) |
| agent session, follow-up turns | 14751 (14713-14764) at the last turn | see below | up to 64 | 3 | see below | 95.4 (26.7-137.0) | 1.39 (0.90-1.69) |

Ranges are the lowest and highest of the runs; `Runs` counts requests that returned a token.

### Agent session (conversation cache)

Cache hit over the follow-up turns: 69.4 % (69.4-69.5); earlier-turn tokens read again per session: 4 (4-4) (earlier turns that the cache did not hold; the 13928 (13928-13928) new tokens of the files are read once); first turn (nothing cached) first token: 0.96 s (0.41-1.07).

| Turn (run 1) | Prompt tokens | Reused | Read | Prompt tok/s | First token (s) | Decode tok/s |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 0 | 609 | 0 | 609 | 675.8 | 0.958 | 58.4 |
| 1 | 4105 | 619 | 3486 | 2173.6 | 1.688 | 95.4 |
| 2 | 5638 | 4168 | 1470 | 1583.7 | 0.997 | 115.2 |
| 3 | 9187 | 5701 | 3486 | 2368.4 | 1.555 | 83.7 |
| 4 | 11913 | 9230 | 2683 | 2055.8 | 1.388 | 73.9 |
| 5 | 14751 | 11944 | 2807 | 2171.1 | 1.375 | 97.7 |

Per-request data: `results.json`. Engine log lines from the start: `engine-log-excerpt.txt` (when this run started the server).

## Correctness and limitations

Not measured: this is a speed suite. The conversation uses the model's own replies, so token counts differ a little between runs. Machine details come from the server, `nvidia-smi`/`rocm-smi` and the OS; background load and power limits are not recorded. Total time of the suite: 64 s.
